Greetings, apprentice summoner,
This is a guide on both basic deck building and how to use this program.

To begin, you should first pick a commander. As Commander is a very casual format, don't worry as much about if your deck will be
'meta. Instead, pick a commander with a cool or interesting effect you want to do more with or one with some art you like.
You should also consider how the commanders color fits into the 'color pie', as this will determine how the deck plays.

To learn more about how the different colors play and their lore, visit: https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Color

Commander format has some rules that differentiate it from other formats, one of those being deck size.
While other formats allow varied deck sizes from 40 to 60 cards, commander requires 99 cards and one commander.
Also, with the exception of basic lands, you may only play one of each card name (unless specified otherwise)

How does this thing work then?
after picking your commander, a request is sent to the scryfall api, creating a new deck with the .csv format
and adding it in to the deck. From then on, when refering to a deck for adding cards or some such, any request
uses that commanders color_identity, ensuring that the deck is legal.

What choices have been made?
As mentioned before, this is not meant for competetive. Outside of precisely simulating the deck and each card interaction for
the opening turns of a game thousands of times, it wouldn't be possible to programatically find a formula for what cards to play

Instead, this uses webscraping to find a card on mtggoldfish and use the data is has concerning what cards are being played in
similar decks to reccomend cards as a shortcut instead of having to teach a computer the mtg meta and rulings concerning timing
