how to simulate deck, in theory:
each card has a cost, lands have a cost of zero
if there is a zero cost card in hand, play it, but only once per turn
every turn add one card to hand
cards can have one of two effects, either add more cards to hand or increase the total cost
using the total cost, play cards

how to use hypergeometric formula:


ramp should cost less than commander eg 4cmc commander ramp should be 0-2 mana
average cost of core cards

= 31.42 + 3.13 * average mana value of your spells â€“ 0.28 * number of cheap card draw or mana ramp spells
